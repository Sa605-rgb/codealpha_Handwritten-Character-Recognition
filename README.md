# codealpha_Handwritten-Character-Recognition
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten English alphabet characters (Aâ€“Z) from image data. The model is trained on the EMNIST Letters dataset, which extends the popular MNIST format for letters. It predicts the corresponding character from user-written input with high accuracy.
